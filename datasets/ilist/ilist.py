This datasets in introduced as task which aimed at identifying 5 closely-related languages of Indo-Aryan language family â€“ Hindi (also known as Khari Boli), Braj Bhasha, Awadhi, Bhojpuri and Magahi. These languages form part of a continuum starting from Western Uttar Pradesh (Hindi and Braj Bhasha) to Eastern Uttar Pradesh (Awadhi and Bhojpuri) and the neighbouring Eastern state of Bihar (Bhojpuri and Magahi). For this task, participants were provided with a dataset of approximately 15,000 sentences in each language, mainly from the domain of literature, published over the web as well as in print.
