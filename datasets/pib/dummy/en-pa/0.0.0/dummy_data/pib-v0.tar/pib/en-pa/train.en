Prime Minister's Office PM releases commemorative postage stamp on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Yogoda Satsanga Society of India
Speaking on the occasion, at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi, the Prime Minister appreciated Swami Paramahansa Yogananda, and said that the path shown by him is not about Mukti, but about Antaryatra. 
He said that though Swami Paramahansa Yogananda left the shores of India to spread his message, he always remained connected with India.
The Prime Minister said India's spirituality is its strength, and it is unfortunate that some people link even spirituality with religion, whereas the two are very different.

Dahej has become a small India in a way. There will be no district of the country whose people are not here and whose means of livelihood is not connected to this city.
