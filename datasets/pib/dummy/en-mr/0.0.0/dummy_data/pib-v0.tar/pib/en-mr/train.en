Parents in most parts of the country must be busy with their childrens examinations.
There would be a sense of relief where the examinations are over, but where the examinations are still on, there certainly would still be some amount of pressure.
However, at a time like this I would only say that students may listen again to what I had said in my Mann Ki Baat last time.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
I also assure the citizens of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, and a good friend, and we will continue to work together shoulder to shoulder to contribute towards the peace, security and development of this entire region.
After the Jallianwallah Massacre by the British in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the legendary figures, who raised their voices in protest.
And it was at the same time, that this event left a very deep impact on a twelve-year-old boy.
And Bhagat, that 12-year old boy in 1919, evolved to be the martyr Bhagat Singh, our dear hero and inspiration.
There was a sense of fulfillment on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru for having served Mother India - - there was no fear of death.
